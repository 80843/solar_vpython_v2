# ðŸŒŒ Solar System Simulation using VPython

This project is a simple yet visually engaging simulation of our solar system built using **VPython**. It demonstrates planetary motion and basic orbital dynamics in a 3D space.

Created as part of a YouTube tutorial by [Your Name], this script is beginner-friendly and runs smoothly in **VS Code**, **Python IDLE**, or any standard Python environment.
